jQuery "Just Slide" content slider.

Usage:

	<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.js"></script>
	<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.justslide.js"></script>
	<script type="text/javascript">
		//More options to come later
	 	var options = {
			display: 2, // This is the number of items to show at any given time. Default is 2
			slide: 1, // This is how many items to slide to the left or right at a time. Default is 1
			speed: 'slow', // This is the speed of the animation. Any normal jquery speed
			next: '#my_next_link', // If you don't supply this, you can't move next :p
			prev: '#my_prev_link' // If you don't supply this, you can't move back :p
		}
		jQuery(function() {
			$('#slider').justslide(options);
		});
	</script>
	
 	This could easily be a "ul" tag.
 	The inner slides don't need a class on them. 

 	<div id="slider">
		<div class="slide">stuff in here</div>
		<div class="slide">more stuff in here</div>
		<div class="slide">even more stuff in here</div>
	</div>
